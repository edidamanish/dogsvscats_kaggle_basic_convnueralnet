Used basic convolutional neural net to classify dogs and cats


Download the dataset at https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats-redux-kernels-edition/data

1) Preprocessed the train and test data
2) Used a basic 6-layer convolutional neural network to train the training data
3) Displayed the probability of the pic being of a dog (1=dog, 0=cat)

Problems Facing...
1) I can't get the matplotlib library to work on the terminal after starting tensorflow. (I have commented the code I used)
